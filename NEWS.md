# ARUtools 0.6.2

# ARUtools 0.6.2

* Initial CRAN submission.

## New

Changes made to improve clarity for CRAN submission.

# ARUtools 0.6.0

## New
* Cleaned up functions for recording selection, spectrograms, clipping waves, 
  acoustic indices and creating dirs (#8, #11, #12, #13, #23)
* Added NSE for relevant functions, these now use `col_COLNAME`, changed arguments
for non-NSE functions to `name_COLNAME` (#15)
* Ensure that data order is unchanged when passing through cleaning functions (#19)
* Added sampling vignette

## Bugs
* Fixed bug `calc_sun()` corrupting date column (#18)

# ARUtools 0.5.1

## New
* `add_wildtrax()` - New helper function to create and append WildTrax file names

## Bugs
* `clean_gps()` - Fixed errors when processing only GPX files


# ARUtools 0.5.0

* `clean_gps()`
  * can handle GPX files via `sf` now
  * distance cutoff results in a warning (not an error), returning
    the data with the `max_dist` column, so users can see which site was problematic.
  * now checks for distance by site groups `aru_id` and `site_id` by default
  * pattern matches for GPS column headers have been expanded
  * catches errors but continues reporting on failed loading (remove `skip_bad` argument)
  * `check_problems()` now also checks GPS meta data

* `create_pattern_XXX()` 
  * Now accept multiple options
  * all separators are non-optional, but provide `""` as pseudo-optional
  * `create_pattern_site_id()` ids do not have to have a suffix
  
* `clean_metadata()` accepts multiple pattern options

* `clean_site_index()` allows no date columns (`col_date_time = NULL`)

* `add_sites()`
  * Rename `dt_type` to `by_date`
  * Take mean of multiple sites with `by_date = "date"` (instead of truncating)
  * Use `by_date = NULL` to skip joining by date range

* Workflow now works with sf input (must be POINT geometries)
  * `clean_site_index()`
  * `add_sites()`
  * `calc_sun()`

* Timezones are now more explicit
  * Expect local time marked with UTC
  * Existing non-UTC timezones are stripped with a message
  * Errors returned if there are more than one relevant date_time column with 
    different timezones
    
* Vignettes
  * Mini spatial workflow (vignettes/spatial.Rmd)
  * Explaining timezones (vignettes/timezones.Rmd)

# ARUtools 0.4.0.9000
* Major overhaul of first half of the workflow
* Main functions now
 - `clean_metadata()`
 - `clean_gps()` / `clean_site_index()`
 - `add_sites()`
 - `calc_sun()`
* Helper functions for checking, and for creating regex patterns
