In our "Getting started" tutorial, we worked with a set of files that matched the
expected metadata patterns. However, this is probably not going to be the case
much of the time.

Here we'll go over how to customize ARUtools functions to work with your data.

For example, let's assume your files look like this, with two recordings, one
at Site 100-a45 May 4th 2020 at 5:25 am with ARU unit S4A1234. The other at 
Site 102-b56 on the same day but at 5:40 am with ARU unit S4A1111.

```{r}
f <- c(
  "site100-a45/2020_05_04_05_25_00_s4a1234.wav",
  "site102-b56/2020_05_04_05_40_00_s4a1111.wav"
)
```

If we try to clean this with the default arguments, we're going to have some problems.

```{r}
clean_metadata(project_files = f)
```

## Regular expressions

First let's talk a bit about how `clean_metadata()` extracts information.

This function uses [regular expressions](https://stringr.tidyverse.org/articles/regular-expressions.html) 
to match specific text patterns in the file path of each recording. 
Regular expressions are really powerful, but also reasonably complicated and can
be confusing. 

For example, by default, `clean_metadata()` matches site ids with the expression 
`r create_pattern_site_id()`.

Yikes!

Broken down, that means look for a "Q" *or* "P" (`((Q)|(P))`) 
followed by two digits (`\\d{2}`)
followed by a separator, either `_` *or* `-` (`_|-`)
followed by a single digit (`\\d{1}`).

This clearly doesn't define the sites in our example here.
You can supply your own regular expression, instead.

```{r}
m <- clean_metadata(project_files = f, pattern_site_id = "site\\d{3}-(a|b)\\d{2}")
m
m$site_id
```


However, with sites that follow a reasonable pattern of a prefix, followed by digits
and optionally a suffix with digits, it might be easier to use a helper
function to create the regular expression for you.

For example, to create a site id pattern we can use `create_pattern_site_id()`.

We specify the `prefix` text as well as how many digits we might expect, a separator, 
`suffix` text and how many suffix digits there might be.

```{r}
pat_site <- create_pattern_site_id(
  prefix = "site", p_digits = 3,
  sep = "-",
  suffix = c("a", "b"), s_digits = 2
)
pat_site
```

```{r}
m <- clean_metadata(project_files = f, pattern_site_id = pat_site)
m$site_id
```

It can be useful to look at the default patterns in the functions to see what 
might be different in your data. 

See `?create_pattern_date` or any `create_pattern` function to pull up the documentation 
and explore the defaults as well as examples. 

It can also be useful to test out a pattern before running all your files.

We can use the `test_pattern()` function to see if our pattern successfully 
extracts the site id from the first file in our list.
```{r}
test_pattern(f[1], pat_site)
```


Let's continue customizing our metadata patterns by specifying ARU ids, dates and times.

```{r}
pat_aru <- create_pattern_aru_id(arus = "s4a", n_digits = 4)

m <- clean_metadata(
  project_files = f,
  pattern_site_id = pat_site,
  pattern_aru_id = pat_aru,
  pattern_dt_sep = "_"
)
m
```

## Other options

### Date order

Depending on your date formatting, you may also need to specify the order of the 
year, month and day, in addition to changing the pattern. 

```{r}
f <- c(
  "P01-1/05042020_052500_S4A1234.wav",
  "P01-1/05042020_054000_S4A1111.wav"
)
```

```{r}
clean_metadata(
  project_files = f,
  pattern_dt_sep = "_",
  pattern_date = create_pattern_date(order = "mdy"),
  order_date = "mdy"
)
```

Note that you need to specify it once when making the pattern, and then again 
when telling the function how to turn the extracted text into a date.

You can specify more than one order with `c("mdy", "ymd")`, but only do this if
you *know* you have multiple orders in the file names. 
In particular, try to avoid using both `mdy` and `dmy`. Some of these dates can
be ambiguous (for example, what order is 05/05/2020?) and may not be parsed 
correctly in these situations.


### Matching multiple patterns

```{r}
f <- c(
  "P01-1/05042020_052500_S4A1234.wav",
  "P01-1/05042020_054000_S4A1111.wav",
  "Site10/2020-01-01T09:00:00_BARLT100.wav",
  "Site10/2020-01-02T09:00:00_BARLT100.wav"
)
```

Sometimes your files may use more than one pattern. You can address this problem
in one of two ways. 

**One option is to run `clean_metadata()` twice and then join the outputs**

```{r}
m1 <- clean_metadata(
  project_files = f,
  pattern_dt_sep = "_",
  pattern_date = create_pattern_date(order = "mdy"),
  order_date = "mdy"
)
m1 <- filter(m1, !is.na(date_time)) # omit ones that didn't work
m1

m2 <- clean_metadata(
  project_files = f,
  pattern_site_id = create_pattern_site_id(prefix = "Site", s_digits = 0),
  pattern_aru_id = create_pattern_aru_id(n_digits = 3)
)
m2 <- filter(m2, !is.na(date_time)) # omit ones that didn't work
m2

m <- bind_rows(m1, m2)
m
```

With this approach you should check that the number of files in the end matches
the number you expect.

```{r}
nrow(m)
```

**Another option is to supply multiple patterns to `clean_metadata()` or to the
`create_pattern_XXX()` functions**

```{r}
m <- clean_metadata(
  project_files = f,
  pattern_dt_sep = c("_", "T"),
  pattern_date = create_pattern_date(order = c("ymd", "mdy")),
  order_date = c("ymd", "mdy"),
  pattern_aru_id = create_pattern_aru_id(n_digits = c(3, 4)),
  pattern_site_id = create_pattern_site_id(
    prefix = c("P", "Site"),
    sep = c("-", ""),
    s_digits = c(1, 0)
  )
)
m
```

**Which approach you should use depends on the situation.**

The first approach means that the patterns being matched are more rigid. 
There is less of a chance of accidentally matching an incorrect pattern.
However, there is a chance of omitting files that don't match either pattern.

The second approach is more flexible in matching patterns and allows you to do
so all in one step, which is convenient. 
However, the more flexible a pattern is, the more opportunities there are to get
incorrect matches and date parsing. 

With both approaches, it is important to double check the results and make sure
the ids and date/times make sense.

```{r}
check_meta(m)
check_meta(m, date = TRUE)
check_problems(m)

unique(m$site_id)
unique(m$aru_id)
```


### Subsetting files

You may not want to extract meta data for every file in your list or directory.
Possibly this is because they're not relevant recordings, or because you have
some formatting issues that make it easier to split into separate groups first.

You can omit files using the `subset` and `subset_type` arguments.

To keep only certain files, use the default `subset_type = "keep"`. To omit
certain files, use `subset_type = "omit"`.

To keep only files with the "a" prefix (note that `^` means 'at the start')
```{r}
clean_metadata(project_files = example_files, subset = "^a")
```

To omit all files with the "a" prefix
```{r}
clean_metadata(project_files = example_files, subset = "^a", subset_type = "omit")
```

### Matching non-wave files

By default `clean_metadata()` looks for .wav files. If you want it to match 
something else, adjust the `file_type` argument.

```{r}
f <- c(
  "a_BARLT10962_P01_1/P01_1_20200502T050000_ARU.mp4",
  "a_BARLT10962_P01_1/P01_1_20200503T052000_ARU.mp4"
)
```

Other wise we'll run into problems...
```{r, error = TRUE}
clean_metadata(project_files = f)
```

```{r}
clean_metadata(project_files = f, file_type = "mp4")
```
